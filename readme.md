# Personal Portfolio 'PP'
Provided are common components and templates that would be required to make an IMO decent looking portfolio.

# Requirements
Usage has only been tested on linux with yarn.

# Usage
1. Edit main.tsx in /src/templates/main or create a new template refering to main.
2. Edit my-conf.tsx in /src to match your template.
3. Add/Change Main Route in App.tsx to route to your template with supplied config.
4. Test using storybook and build with webpack.
5. Profit.

# Contributing
Feel free to fork and PR this repo and expand on the components, sticking with the theme (or not).

Help with documentation would be much appreciated.
